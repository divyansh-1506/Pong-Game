# Pong-Game
Gui based game created in cpp using graphics.h. 

|"Compiling Instructions"|

This "Pong Game" is created using graphics.h library, using cpp.
I have used CodeBlocks and externally dropped graphics.h in its compiler include folder.



Source code is provided with the commit as 'main.cpp' but to compile the code one must have graphics.h in their include folder of cpp compiler. 
Use Turbo C++ in order to compile the code, as it has graphics.h by default.

*OR YOU CAN DIRECTLY RUN .exe FILE TO PLAY THE GAME*

|"Playing Instructions"|

Use up and down arrow key to move the right paddle.
